**Day1**
1. Hours in a year. How many hours are in a year?
2. Minutes in a decade. How many minutes are in a decade?
3. Your age in seconds. How many seconds old are you? (I'm not going to check your answer, so be as accurate—or not—as you want.)
4. Cristina Tarantino: 32 yesterday! How many milliseconds old is she hahaha? Calculate @Cristina Tarantino's age in milliseconds.

**Here are some tougher questions:**

1. How many days does it take for a 32-bit system to timeout, if it has a bug with integer overflow?
2. How about a 64-bit system?
3. Calculate your age accurately based on your birthday (maybe use time of day e.g. 8:23am if you know it, use 12:00 noon midday) - you will need JavaScript DateTime functionality.

**Day 2**
**Few things to try**
1. Music:
  - Calculate and console.log the frequency each of the 12 notes between A and A' 
  - Hint: the notes are NOT in a linear scale, but in a geometric scale
    - A 440 Hz 
    - 1 octave is double the frequency tempered piano 
    - A' 880 Hz 
2. Planets: 
  - Calculate and console log how many 'minutes' the Moon travels in a day. 
  - Hint: first calculate how many degrees the Moons travels in the sky when the Earth returns to the same position during its daily rotation.
3. Take a look at JavaScript operators, a bit more advanced: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators

**Day 3***
**Few Things to Try**
1. Full name greeting. Write a program that asks for a person’s first name, then middle, and then last. Finally, it should greet the person using their full name.
2. Bigger, better favorite number. Write a program that asks for a person’s favorite number. Have your program add 1 to the number, and then suggest the result as a bigger and better favorite number. (Do be tactful about it, though.)
3. Angry boss. Write an angry boss program that rudely asks what you want. Whatever you answer, the angry boss should yell it back to you and then fire you. For example, if you type in I want a raise, it should yell back like this:
```WHADDAYA MEAN "I WANT A RAISE"?!? YOU'RE FIRED!!```
4. Table of contents. Here’s something for you to do in order to play around more with center, ljust, and rjust: write a program that will display a table of contents so that it looks like this:

Table of Contents

Chapter 1: Getting Started page 1 Chapter 2: Numbers page 9 Chapter 3: Letters page 13

Optional: in JS we may prefer to 'print' these to the HTML file itself rather than the console.

**Random Numbers - Optional**
1. Generate a random number
- Research how to generate a random number with JavaScript. (Math.random() will output a random number from 0 up to but not including 1)
    - between 1 and 10
    - between 1 and 100
    - between 1930 and 1950

2. Then try to generate your random Civilization III world by generating a land 'X' tile or a water 'o' tile randomly:

  - oooXXXoo
  - oooXoXoo
  - XXXooXoo

3. The Math Object - Optional
