**Day1**
1. Hours in a year. How many hours are in a year?
2. Minutes in a decade. How many minutes are in a decade?
3. Your age in seconds. How many seconds old are you? (I'm not going to check your answer, so be as accurate—or not—as you want.)
4. Cristina Tarantino: 32 yesterday! How many milliseconds old is she hahaha? Calculate @Cristina Tarantino's age in milliseconds.

**Here are some tougher questions:**

1. How many days does it take for a 32-bit system to timeout, if it has a bug with integer overflow?
2. How about a 64-bit system?
3. Calculate your age accurately based on your birthday (maybe use time of day e.g. 8:23am if you know it, use 12:00 noon midday) - you will need JavaScript DateTime functionality.

**Day 2**
**Few things to try**
1. Music:
  - Calculate and console.log the frequency each of the 12 notes between A and A' 
  - Hint: the notes are NOT in a linear scale, but in a geometric scale
    - A 440 Hz 
    - 1 octave is double the frequency tempered piano 
    - A' 880 Hz 
2. Planets: 
  - Calculate and console log how many 'minutes' the Moon travels in a day. 
  - Hint: first calculate how many degrees the Moons travels in the sky when the Earth returns to the same position during its daily rotation.
3. Take a look at JavaScript operators, a bit more advanced: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators
